\title{Geodetic Distances from Latitude and Longitude}
\usage{
geoDist(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, NAOK = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2}{Latitude and longitude co-ordinates for the two
sets of points.}

\item{NAOK}{Are \code{NA} values allowed in the co-ordinates?  Default:
\code{TRUE}. If so, corresponding elements of the distance will also be
\code{NA}.}
}
\value{
numeric vector of distances, optionally including \code{NA} values
if those are allowed and present in any of the coordinates.
}
\description{
Given two sets of points on the earth's surface in latitude, longitude form,
returns the geodetic distances in meters between corresponding points.
}
\details{
Uses a classic Fortran algorithm implementing a method that allows for the
non-spherical shape of the earth.  See comments in the Fortran code for the
history of the implementation.
