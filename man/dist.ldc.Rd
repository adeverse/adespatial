\description{
Compute dissimilarity indices for ecological data matrices. The dissimilarity
indices computed by this function are those described in Legendre and De
Cáceres (2013). In the name of the function, 'ldc' stands for the author's
names. Twelve of these 21 indices are not readily available in other R
package functions; four of them can, however, be computed in two computation
steps in \code{vegan}.
}
\details{
The dissimilarities computed by this function are the following.
  Indices i and k designate two rows (sites) of matrix Y, j designates a
  column (species). D[ik] is the dissimilarity between rows i and k. p is the
  number of columns (species) in Y; pp is the number of species present in
  one or the other site, or in both. y[i+] is the sum of values in row i;
  same for y[k+]. y[+j] is the sum of values in column j. y[++] is the total
  sum of values in Y. The indices are computed by functions written in C for
  greater computation speed with large data matrices. \itemize{ 
  \item Group 1 - D computed by transformation of Y followed by Euclidean distance
  \itemize{ \item Hellinger D, D[ik] =
  sqrt(sum((sqrt(y[ij]/y[i+])-sqrt(y[kj]/y[k+]))^2)) (Rao 1995)
  \item chord D, D[ik] =
  sqrt(sum((y[ij]/sqrt(sum(y[ij]^2))-y[kj]/sqrt(sum(y[kj]^2)))^2)) 
  (Orlóci 1967)
  \item log-chord D, D[ik] = chord D[ik] computed on 
  log(y[ij]+1)-transformed data (Legendre & Borcard 2018) 
  \item chi-square D, D[ik] = sqrt(y[++]  
  sum((1/j[+j])(y[ij]/y[i+]-y[kj]/y[k+])^2)) (Lebart & Fénelon 1971)
  \item species profiles D, D[ik] = sqrt(sum((y[ij]/y[i+]-y[kj]/y[k+])^2)) 
  (Legendre & Legendre (2012) }

  \item Group 2 - Other D functions appropriate for beta diversity studies
  where A = sum(min(y[ij],y[kj])), B = y[i+]-A, C = y[k+]-A 
  \itemize{ \item percentage difference D (aka Bray-Curtis), 
  D[ik] = (sum(abs(y[ij]-y[k,j])))/(y[i+]+y[k+]) 
  or else, D[ik] = (B+C)/(2A+B+C) (Odum 1950)
  \item Ružička D, D[ik] = 1-(sum(min(y[ij],y[kj])/sum(max(y[ij],y[kj]))
  or else, D[ik] = (B+C)/(A+B+C) (Ružička 1958)
  \item coefficient of divergence D, D[ik] =
  sqrt((1/pp)sum(((y[ij]-y(kj])/(y[ij]+y(kj]))^2)) (Clark 1952)
  \item Canberra metric D,
  D[ik] = (1/pp)sum(abs(y[ij]-y(kj])/(y[ij]+y(kj])) (Lance & Williams 1967)
  \item Whittaker D, 
  D[ik] = 0.5*sum(abs(y[ij]/y[i+]-y(kj]/y[k+])) (Whittaker 1952)
  \item Wishart D, D[ik] = 1-sum(y[ij]y[kj])
  /(sum(y[ij]^2)+sum(y[kj]^2)-sum(y[ij]y[kj])) (Wishart 1969)
  \item Kulczynski D, D[ik] =
  1-0.5((sum(min(y[ij],y[kj])/y[i+]+sum(min(y[ij],y[kj])/y[k+])) }

  \item Group 3 - Classical indices for binary data; they are appropriate for
  beta diversity studies. Value a is the number of species found in both i
  and k, b is the number of species in site i not found in k, and c is the
  number of species found in site k but not in i. The D matrices are
  square-root transformed, as in dist.binary of ade4; the user-oriented
  reason for this transformation is explained below. \itemize{
  \item Jaccard coefficient of community (CC), D[ik] = sqrt((b+c)/(a+b+c))
  (Jaccard 1901, CC described in a sentence; 1908, CC shown as an equation)
  \item Sørensen D, D[ik] = sqrt((b+c)/(2a+b+c)) (Sørensen 1948)
  \item Ochiai D, D[ik] = sqrt(1 - a/sqrt((a+b)(a+c))) (Ochiai 1957) }

  \item Group 4 - Abundance-based indices of Chao et al. (2006) for
  quantitative abundance data. These functions correct the index for species
  that have not been observed due to sampling errors. For the meaning of the
  U and V notations, see Chao et al. (2006, section 3). When
  \code{samp=TRUE}, the abundance-based distances (ab.jaccard, ab.sorensen,
  ab.ochiai, ab.simpson) are computed for sample data. If \code{samp=FALSE},
  indices are computed for true population data. - Do not use indices of
  group 4 with \code{samp=TRUE} on presence-absence data; the indices are not
  meant to accommodate this type of data. If \code{samp=FALSE} is used with
  presence-absence data, the indices are the regular Jaccard, Sørensen,
  Ochiai and Simpson indices. On output, however, the D matrices are not
  square-rooted, contrary to the Jaccard, Sørensen and Ochiai indices in
  section 3 which are square-rooted. \itemize{ 
  \item abundance-based Jaccard D, D[ik] = 1-(UV/(U+V-UV)) 
  \item abundance-based Sørensen D, D[ik] = 1-(2UV/(U+V)) 
  \item abundance-based Ochiai D, D[ik] = 1-sqrt(UV) 
  \item abundance-based Simpson D, D[ik] = 1-(UV/(UV+min((U-UV),(V-UV)))) }

  \item Group 5 - General-purpose dissimilarities that do not have an upper
  bound (maximum D value). They are inappropriate for beta diversity studies.
  \itemize{ 
  \item Euclidean D, D[ik] = sqrt(sum(y[ij]-y[kj])^2) 
  \item Manhattan D, D[ik] = sum(abs(y[ij] - y[ik])) 
  \item modified mean character difference, 
  D[ik] = (1/pp) sum(abs(y[ij] - y[ik])) (Legendre & Legendre (2012) } } 

  The properties of
  all dissimilarities available in this function (except Ružička D) were
  described and compared in Legendre & De Cáceres (2013), who showed that
  most of these dissimilarities are appropriate for beta diversity studies.
  Inappropriate are the Euclidean, Manhattan, modified mean character
  difference, species profile and chi-square distances. Most of these
  dissimilarities have a maximum value of either 1 or sqrt(2). Three
  dissimilarities (Euclidean, Manhattan, Modified mean character difference)
  do not have an upper bound and are thus inappropriate for beta diversity
  studies. The chi-square distance has an upper bound of sqrt(2*(sum(Y))).
  \cr\cr The Euclidean, Hellinger, chord, chi-square and
  species profiles dissimilarities have the property of being Euclidean,
  meaning that they never produce negative eigenvalues in principal
  coordinate analysis. The Canberra, Whittaker, percentage difference,
  Wishart and Manhattan coefficients are Euclidean when they are square-root
  transformed (Legendre & De Cáceres 2013, Table 2). The distance forms (1-S)
  of the Jaccard, Sørensen and Ochiai similarity (S) coefficients are
  Euclidean after taking the square root of (1-S) (Legendre & Legendre 2012,
  Table 7.2). The D matrices resulting from these three coefficients are
  outputted in the form sqrt(1-S), as in function \code{dist.binary} of ade4,
  because that form is Euclidean and will thus produce no negative
  eigenvalues in principal coordinate analysis. \cr\cr The Hellinger, chord,
  chi-square and species profile dissimilarities are computed using the
  two-step procedure developed by Legendre & Gallagher (2001). The data are
  first transformed using either the row marginals, or the row and column
  marginals in the case of the chi-square distance. The dissimilarities are
  then computed from the transformed data using the Euclidean distance
  formula. As a consequence, these four dissimilarities are necessarily
  Euclidean. D matrices for other binary coefficients can be computed in two
  ways: either by using function \code{dist.binary} of ade4, or by choosing
  option \code{binary=TRUE}, which transforms the abundance data to binary
  form, and using one of the quantitative indices of the present function.
  Table 1 of Legendre & De Cáceres (2013) shows the incidence-based
  (presence-absence-based) indices computed by the various indices using
  binary data. \cr\cr The Euclidean distance computed on untransformed
  presence-absence or abundance data produces non-informative and incorrect
  ordinations, as shown in Legendre & Legendre (2012, p. 300) and in Legendre
  & De Cáceres (2013). However, the Euclidean distance computed on
  log-transformed abundance data produces meaningful ordinations in principal
  coordinate analysis (PCoA). Nonetheless, it is easier to compute a PCA of
  log-transformed abundance data instead of a PCoA; the resulting ordination
  with scaling 1 will be meaningful. Messages are printed to the R console
  indicating the Euclidean status of the computed dissimilarity matrices.
  Note that for the chi-square distance, the columns that sum to zero are
  eliminated before calculation of the distances, thus preventing divisions
  by zero in the calculation of the chi-square transformation.
