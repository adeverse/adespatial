|  CONSTRAINED HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING                       |

|                                                            |
|  C implementation of the Lance and Williams (1967) method  |
|  for hierarchical clustering with or without the spatial   |
|  contiguity constraint.                                    |

|  The present implementation has been vastly inspirered by  |
|  the original HCLUST Fortran code by                       |
|  F. Murtagh, ESA/ESO/STECF, Garching, February 1986.       |

|  Also contains:                                            |
|  Least squares (non distance-based) agglomerative          |
|  clustering with or without the spatial contiguity         |
|  constraint.                                               |
|                                                            |
|  Performance was enhanced by carefully buffering the       |
|  identity (unconstrained case) and the values of nearest   |
|  neighbour dissimilarities (both unconstrained and         |
|  constrained cases) for each observations (unconstrained   |
|  case) or links (constrained case). This type of           |
|  performance enhancement is present in recent hclust       |
|  implementations and has been originally proposed by       |
|  Langfelder and Horvath (2012, Journal of Statistical      |
|  Software, 46(11), 1-17) for the unconstrained case in     |
|  package flashClust.                                       |
|                                                            |
