    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>mat1, mat2</dt>
<dd><p>Two multivariate community composition or gene frequency
data matrices (class data.frame or matrix) with the same number of rows and
columns. The rows must correspond to the same objects (e.g. sites) and the
columns to the same variables, e.g. species or alleles. –  
The input files are checked for having equal numbers of rows and columns, for  
rows that are empty in <b>both</b> mat1 and mat2, and for the presence of negative  
values, which cannot be frequencies.</p></dd>


<dt>method</dt>
<dd><p>One of the following dissimilarity coefficients:
<code>"%difference"</code> (aka Bray-Curtis), <code>"ruzicka"</code>, <code>"chord"</code>,
<code>"hellinger"</code>, <code>"log.chord"</code>, <code>"sorensen"</code>,
<code>"jaccard"</code>, <code>"ochiai"</code>, <code>"euclidean"</code>. See Details. Names
can be abbreviated to a non-ambiguous set of first letters. Default:
<code>method="%difference"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>pa.tr</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>pa.tr=TRUE</code>, the data are transformed to binary (i.e.
presence-absence, or pa) form. If <code>pa.tr=FALSE</code>, they are not.</p></dd>


<dt>nperm</dt>
<dd><p>Number of permutations for the tests of significance of the
temporal beta indices and the permutation test of the B-C difference. Use
<code>nperm</code> = 999 or 9999 in real studies.</p></dd>


<dt>BCD</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>BCD=TRUE</code>, the B and C components of the
percentage difference (<code>method="%difference"</code>) and Ruzicka
(<code>method"ruzicka"</code>) indices are computed and presented in an output
table with three columns: B/den, C/den, D=(B+C)/den, where den is the
denominator of the index, i.e. (2A+B+C) for the percentage difference index
and (A+B+C) for the Ruzicka index. See Details and Value. If
<code>pa.tr=TRUE</code>, the B and C components are the numbers of species lost
or gained, and D is either the Sorensen or the Jaccard dissimilarity. In
the BCD output table, column B contains B/den, C/den, D=(B+C)/den, as in
the case of the percentage difference and Ruzicka indices.</p>
<p>If <code>BCD=FALSE</code>, that table is not produced. No table can be computed for
indices other than the Ruzicka and percentage difference or their binary
forms.</p></dd>


<dt>replace</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>FALSE</code> (default value),
sampling is done without replacement, producing a regular permutation test.
If <code>TRUE</code>, sampling is done with replacement for the
test of significance; the method is then bootstrapping.</p></dd>


<dt>test.BC</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the difference between
species (or abundances-per-species) gains (C/den) and species (or
abundances-per-species) losses (B/den) is tested in a parametric paired
t-test computed by function <code>t.test</code> of <code>stats</code>. If
<code>FALSE</code>, the test is not computed.</p></dd>


<dt>test.t.perm</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the difference
between species (or abundances-per-species) gains (C/den) and species (or
abundances-per-species) losses (B/den) is also tested in a permutational
paired t-test computed by function <code>t.paired.perm</code>.If
<code>FALSE</code>, the test is not computed.</p></dd>


<dt>save.BC</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the original B and C
values are returned in a matrix called <code>BC</code>, without division by den
as in the output matrix <code>BCD.mat</code>. If <code>FALSE</code>, BC
will get the value NA in the output list.</p></dd>


<dt>seed.</dt>
<dd><p>Seed for random number generator. If <code>NULL</code>, the random 
number generator keeps going from the point it had reached in previous
calculations. If <code>seed.</code> is an integer value instead of NULL,
the random number generator is reset using that value. This allows users to
repeat exactly a previous calculation launched with the same value of
<code>seed.</code>; the sequence of generated random numbers will be exactly the
same.</p></dd>


<dt>clock</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>clock=TRUE</code>, the computation time is printed. This
option is useful to predict the calculation time when <em>n</em> and
<em>nperm</em> are large.</p></dd>

    <div id="value">
    <h2>Value</h2>
    

<p>Function TBI returns a list containing the following results:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p><code>TBI</code> The vector of Temporal Beta-diversity Indices
  (TBI) between observations at times T1 and T2 for each object.</p></li>
<li><p><code>p.TBI</code> A corresponding vector of p-values. Significant p-values
  (e.g. p.TBI &lt;= 0.05) indicate exceptional objects for the difference of
  their species composition.</p></li>
<li><p><code>p.adj</code> The p-values are corrected for multiple testing using
  function p.adjust of <code>stats</code>. The adjustment is done using
  <code>method="holm"</code>, which is the default option of the <code>p.adjust</code>
  function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>BCD.mat</code> An output table with four columns: B/den, C/den,
  D=(B+C)/den, and Change. The value den is the denominator of the index,
  i.e. (2A+B+C) for the percentage difference index and (A+B+C) for the
  Ruzicka index. The decomposition is such that D = B/den + C/den. Columns B
  and C indicate which of the D values are associated with large B (losses)
  or large C values (gains), before proceeding to the analysis and
  interpretation of the D values, using environmental or spatial explanatory
  variables, through regression or classification tree analysis. When B &gt; C,
  the site has lost species or abundances-per-species between time 1 and time
  2; this is indicated by a "-" sign in column Change. On the contrary, if B
  &lt; C, the site has gained species or abundances-per-species between time 1
  and time 2; this is indicated by a "+" sign in that column. Sites with
  equal amounts of losses and gains are marked with a "0". - The B/den and
  C/den values can be plotted in B-C plots, which are informative about the
  changes that occurred in the data set between the two surveys under study.
  - If <code>pa.tr</code> is TRUE, the B and C components are the numbers of
  spepcies losses and gains, and D is either the Sorensen or the Jaccard
  dissimilarity. - If <code>BCD=FALSE</code>, that table is not produced. No table
  is (or can be) computed for indices other than the Ruzicka and percentage
  difference indices or their binary forms.</p></li>
<li><p><code>BCD.summary</code>	An output table with six columns: mean(B/den);
  mean(C/den); mean(D); B/(B+C) (which is mean(B/den) divided by mean(D));
  C/(B+C) (which is mean(C/den) divided by mean(D)). These values indicate,
  over all sites, which of the processes dominated (loss or gain of species
  or abundances-per-species) when site compositions changed between time 1
  and time 2. Change has the same meaning as in table <code>BCD.mat</code>; the
  sign indicates the direction of the mean change over all sites.</p></li>
<li><p><code>t.test_B.C</code>	The results of a paired t-test (parametric) of
  significance of the difference between columns C/den and B/den of the
  <code>BCD.mat</code> table. If <code>test.t.perm=TRUE</code>, the difference between
  species gains (C/den) and losses (B/den) is also tested in a permutational
  paired t-test and the permutational p-value is shown in the output table.
  This result provides an overall test of the direction of change over all
  sites. It helps confirm the asymmetry between species (or
  abundances-per-species) gains (C/den) and species (or
  abundances-per-species) losses (B/den). A star in column p&lt;=0.05 indicates
  a significant result of the parametric test at the 0.05 level.</p></li>
<li><p><code>BC</code>	An output table with two columns: B and C. In this table,
  the B and C statistics are not divided by a denominator, contrary to the
  values B/den and C/den found in the output table <code>BCD.mat</code>.</p></li>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>For each object, the function tests the hypothesis (H0) that a
species assemblage is not exceptionally different between T1 and T2, compared
to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at T1 and T2 under
conditions corresponding to H0. If H0 is rejected, the object is recognized
as exceptionally different from the other objects for its difference between
T1 and T2.</p>
<p><em>To fix ideas, an example in palaeoecology</em> - A researcher is studying
ancient and modern diatom communities in sediment cores. If a site displays
an exceptional difference between T1 and T2, the researcher is justified to
examine the reason for that difference. It could, for example, be caused by a
change in land use at that site, which has caused the difference to be larger
than at the other sites, compared to the differences caused by climate change
at all sites.</p>
<p>The temporal beta diversity indices available in this function belong to four
groups, computed in different ways.</p><ul><li><p>Method
<code>"%difference"</code> computes the percentage difference index, erroneously
called the Bray-Curtis index in some software packages ; it is the
quantitative form of the Sorensen index. Method <code>"ruzicka"</code> computes the
Ruzicka dissimilarity; this is one of the quantitative coefficients
corresponding to the Jaccard dissimilarity for binary data. When these
indices are used to compute ordinations by principal coordinate analysis, it
is recommended to take the square root of the dissimilarities before the
ordination analysis because these indices do not have the property of being
Euclidean. However, that precaution is not important here; the results of
permutation tests will be the same for these dissimilarities, square-rooted
or not. If <code>pa.tr=TRUE</code>, either the Sorensen or the Jaccard coefficient
are obtained by computing these two coefficients.</p></li>
<li><p>Methods
<code>"chord"</code> (chord distance), <code>"hellinger"</code> (Hellinger distance) and
<code>"log.chord"</code> (log.chord distance) are obtained by transformation of the
species data, as described by Legendre &amp; Borcard (2018), followed by
calculation of the Euclidean distance. For the Hellinger distance, the data
are square-rooted, then subjected to the chord transformation and the
Euclidean distance. For the log.chord distance, the data are transformed by
y' = log(y+1) using function log1p() of R, then subjected to the chord
transformation and the Euclidean distance. These three distances have the
Euclidean property (Legendre &amp; Legendre 2012, Legendre &amp; De Caceres 2013). If
<code>pa.tr=TRUE</code>, the  Ochiai distance for binary data,
sqrt(2)*sqrt(1-Ochiai similarity), is obtained from these three coefficients.</p></li>
<li><p>Methods <code>"jaccard"</code>, <code>"sorensen"</code>, <code>"ochiai"</code> implement
the Jaccard, Sorensen and Ochiai dissimilarities. For these coefficients, the
data are first transformed to presence-absence (<code>pa.tr</code> receives the
value <code>TRUE</code>), then the dissimilarities are computed using the
corresponding quantitative coefficients (Ruzicka, percentage difference, and
chord).</p></li>
<li><p>The Euclidean distance is also available in this function. It
is not recommended for community composition or allele frequency data. One
can compute it for log-transformed abundance data that do not contain zeros,
or very few zeros (short gradients).</p></li>
</ul><p>The temporal beta indices are tested for significance using permutation
tests. The hypotheses are the following:</p><ul><li><p>H0: the site under
study (e.g. a species assemblage) is not exceptionally different between T1
and T2, compared to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at
T1 and T2 under conditions corresponding to H0. The differences between T1
and T2 all belong to the same statistical population of differences.</p></li>
<li><p>H1: the site under study is exceptionally different between times T1 and T2.</p></li>
</ul><p>In the decomposition of the Ruzicka and percentage difference dissimilarities
or their presence-absence forms (Jaccard, Sorensen), the components B and C
are computed as follows:</p><ul><li><p>bj is the part of the abundance of
species j that is higher at time 1 than at time 2: bj = (y1j - y2j) if y1j &gt;
y2j ; bj = 0 otherwise. B is the sum of the bj values for all species in the
group of species under study. It is the unscaled sum of species losses
between time 1 and time 2. In the BCD output table BCD.mat, column 1 contains
B/den where den is the denominator of the index, i.e. (2A+B+C) for the
percentage difference index and (A+B+C) for the Ruzicka index.</p></li>
<li><p>cj is
the part of the abundance of species j that is higher at time 2 than at time
1: cj = (y2j - y1j) if y2j &gt; y1j ; cj = 0 otherwise. C is the sum of the cj
values for all species in the group of species under study. It is the
unscaled sum of species gains between time 1 and time 2. In the BCD output
table BCD.mat, column 2 contains C/den where den is the denominator of the
index, i.e. (2A+B+C) for the percentage difference index and (A+B+C) for the
Ruzicka index.</p></li>
</ul><p>The original values of B and C for each site, without denominator, are also
available in the output table BC.</p>
<p><em>Warning</em> - In real ecological studies, when the TBI test is applied to
data where some sites are highly impoverished due to pollution or other
extreme environmental situations, this situation may produce sites with very
few species (i.e. very low richness) and no species in common for the T1-T2
comparisons due to sampling variation at these impoverished sites. The TBI
dissimilarity will be high and the test may indicate a significant T1-T2
difference if most other sites have higher species richness. This would be a
correct statistical outcome for the test. When users of the method identify
sites showing significant TBI tests in data, they should check the species
richness of these sites at T1 and T2. Interpretation of the test results
should be done with caution when high and significant TBI indices are
associated with very low richness and no species in common between T1 and T2.</p>
